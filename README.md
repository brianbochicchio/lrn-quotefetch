# Quote Fetch
**Learning project from the ZTM 20 Projects course.**

This app fetches and displays random quotes. 

After the initial load, you can click the "New Quote" button to fetch a new quote.  If you click the Twitter (X) button,
it will attempt to attach the quote to a new post. 

There's lots of directions to take this in a derivate work. There are also some optimizations that can be made.
